# Quick QR Creator Tool

A lightweight simple tool for generating QR codes with no bullshit (like all those QR generators full of ads and some that even try and make you pay for subscriptions).

Written using the React + Vite framework. Can easily run offline, be hosted as a static site in S3 buckets (or whatever S3 competitor you prefer) when built with very minimal overhead both on the user's machine and the required bandwidth.

Uses standard formats and includes options for many types of social links as well as any URL, phone numbers, emails, calendar events, WiFi networks, coordinates, and more.

Created to help the marketing department but published here as a log of my work and made public in case anyone else finds it handy.

May or may not end up getting maintained.

Feel free to fork as long as you link to this repo as credit for the OG.

Enjoy!
